# Hardware Requirements for Raspberry Pi Voice Detection Project

## Minimum Hardware Specifications
- **Raspberry Pi Model**: Raspberry Pi 3 or later (Raspberry Pi 4 recommended for better performance)
- **Power Supply**: 5V 2.5A power supply (official Raspberry Pi power supply recommended)
- **MicroSD Card**: At least 16GB Class 10 or higher for the operating system and project files
- **Audio Input Device**: USB microphone or compatible sound card with microphone input
- **Audio Output Device**: USB speakers or HDMI output for audio playback
- **Network Connectivity**: Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection for updates and remote access

## Recommended Hardware
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: 2GB or 4GB RAM variant for improved processing capabilities
- **External Sound Card**: If using a Raspberry Pi with limited audio input/output capabilities
- **Heat Sink and Fan**: For better thermal management during prolonged usage
- **Case**: A protective case for the Raspberry Pi to prevent physical damage

## Additional Components
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: For prototyping and connecting additional sensors or components
- **GPIO Components**: If integrating with other hardware (e.g., buttons, LEDs)
- **Camera Module**: Optional, for projects that require visual input alongside voice detection

## Setup Instructions
1. **Prepare the Raspberry Pi**:
   - Install the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS on the microSD card.
   - Connect the Raspberry Pi to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for initial setup.

2. **Connect Audio Devices**:
   - Plug in the USB microphone and speakers.
   - Test audio input and output using the `arecord` and `aplay` commands.

3. **Install Required Software**:
   - Follow the instructions in the `docs/SETUP.md` file to install necessary dependencies and configure the system.

4. **Test Hardware Functionality**:
   - Run the provided scripts in the `scripts/` directory to ensure that audio devices are functioning correctly.

5. **Final Assembly**:
   - Once everything is tested, assemble the Raspberry Pi in its case and connect any additional components as needed.

By following these hardware requirements and setup instructions, you will ensure that your Raspberry Pi voice detection project runs smoothly and efficiently.
