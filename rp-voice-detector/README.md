# Raspberry Pi Voice Detector

## Description
The Raspberry Pi Voice Detector project is designed to provide a robust voice detection system using a Raspberry Pi. It leverages various audio processing techniques and machine learning models to detect voice commands and execute corresponding actions. The system is modular, allowing for easy updates and enhancements.

## Quick Start Guide
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rp-voice-detector.git
   cd rp-voice-detector
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the installation script to set up the required packages:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install_deps.sh
   ```

3. **Configure Audio Devices**
   Use the setup script to configure your audio devices:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_audio.sh
   ```

4. **Calibrate Microphone**
   Calibrate your microphone using the calibration script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/calibrate_mic.sh
   ```

5. **Start the Service**
   Start the voice detection service:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start_service.sh
   ```
