# Raspberry Pi Voice Detection Project - Models Directory

This directory contains the implementation details and configurations for the voice detection models used in the Raspberry Pi Voice Detection project. Below are the components included in this directory:

## Directory Structure

- **`__init__.py`**: Marks the models directory as a Python package.
- **`voice_detection_model.py`**: Implements the core voice detection model interface, defining an abstract base class and specific model implementations.
- **`model_loader.py`**: Handles loading and managing model files, including downloading, verifying integrity, and caching.
- **`model_inference.py`**: Runs model inference efficiently, creating an inference pipeline and managing latency.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework as per the model implementation.
- Ensure that the models are compatible with the Raspberry Pi architecture.

## Instructions

1. **Model Implementation**: 
   - Define the voice detection model in `voice_detection_model.py`. This should include methods for loading the model, running inference, and any necessary preprocessing.
   
2. **Model Loading**: 
   - Use `model_loader.py` to implement functions for downloading and caching model files. Ensure that the integrity of the models is verified after downloading.

3. **Inference Pipeline**: 
   - In `model_inference.py`, create a pipeline that takes audio input, preprocesses it, and runs it through the model to get predictions. Optimize for latency to ensure real-time performance.

4. **Testing**: 
   - Implement unit tests for each component in the `tests` directory to ensure functionality and reliability.

5. **Documentation**: 
   - Update this README file with any additional information regarding model configurations, usage examples, and integration details as the project evolves.

By following these guidelines, you will ensure that the models are well-structured, maintainable, and efficient for the voice detection application.
