# Models Documentation for Raspberry Pi Voice Detection Project

This directory contains the models used in the Raspberry Pi Voice Detection project. The models are essential for processing audio input and detecting voice commands. Below are the key components and instructions related to the models.

## Model Overview

The voice detection models are designed to recognize specific voice commands and perform actions based on those commands. The models leverage machine learning techniques to ensure accurate detection and minimal false positives.

## Model Files

- **model.py**: This file defines the architecture of the voice detection model, including the layers, activation functions, and compilation settings. It is crucial for initializing the model before inference.

- **inference.py**: This file handles the inference process, where the preprocessed audio data is fed into the model to obtain predictions. It includes functions for loading the model and running predictions on new audio samples.

- **postprocess.py**: This file processes the output from the model, extracting relevant information such as detected commands and confidence scores. It ensures that the results are in a usable format for further actions.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Model Initialization**: Before using the models, ensure that they are properly initialized in your application. This typically involves importing the `model.py` file and creating an instance of the model.

2. **Audio Preprocessing**: Use the preprocessing functions defined in the `src/audio/preprocess.py` file to prepare audio data before passing it to the model for inference.

3. **Running Inference**: Call the inference functions from `inference.py` with the preprocessed audio data to get predictions.

4. **Postprocessing Results**: Utilize the functions in `postprocess.py` to interpret the model's output and take appropriate actions based on the detected commands.

## Requirements

Ensure that the following libraries are installed to work with the models:

- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the framework used)
- NumPy
- SciPy

Refer to the `requirements.txt` file for specific version requirements.

## Contribution

If you wish to contribute to the model development, please follow the guidelines outlined in the main project `README.md` and ensure that any changes are well-documented and tested.
