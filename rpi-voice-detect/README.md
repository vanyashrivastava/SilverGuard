# rpi-voice-detect

## Project Title
Raspberry Pi Voice Detection System

## Description
The Raspberry Pi Voice Detection System is a project designed to detect and respond to voice commands using a Raspberry Pi. It utilizes various audio processing techniques and machine learning models to accurately identify voice inputs. The system is modular, allowing for easy updates and enhancements.

## Quick Start Guide
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rpi-voice-detect.git
   cd rpi-voice-detect
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Run the installation script to set up the environment:
   ```
   ./scripts/install-deps.sh
   ```

3. **Configure the microphone:**
   Edit the `configs/microphone.yaml` file to set your microphone parameters.

4. **Run the application:**
   Start the voice detection service:
   ```
   ./scripts/start.sh
   ```
