# Raspberry Pi Voice Detection Project

## Overview
The Raspberry Pi Voice Detection project is designed to provide a robust voice detection system using a Raspberry Pi. This project leverages various audio processing techniques and machine learning models to detect and respond to voice commands.

## Quick Start Guide
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rpi-voice-detect.git
   cd rpi-voice-detect
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the installation script to set up the environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-deps.sh
   ```

3. **Configure the microphone**:
   Edit the `configs/microphone.yaml` file to set your microphone parameters.

4. **Run the application**:
   Start the voice detection service:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start.sh
   ```

## Team Member Responsibilities
- **Project Lead**: Oversees project development and coordinates team efforts.
- **Audio Engineer**: Responsible for audio recording and processing components.
- **Machine Learning Engineer**: Develops and optimizes the voice detection model.
- **Hardware Specialist**: Manages hardware setup and GPIO interactions.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment and environment setup.

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi 3 or later
- USB microphone or compatible I2S microphone
- Internet connection (for updates and dependencies)

## Software Requirements
- Raspbian OS (or any compatible Linux distribution)
- Python 3.7 or later
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
